![Rasmus Lystrøm](/assets/portrait-2018-landscape.jpg "Rasmus Lystrøm")

My name is Rasmus Lystrøm. I'm a senior cloud security/infrastructure/development consultant, professor, army officer, pythonesque looney, and death metal afficionado. I work out of Copenhagen, Denmark for the Secure Infrastructure Domain in Microsoft Services. This blog, its content and opinions are my own.
